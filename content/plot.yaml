    Grimmly awkened from a dream involving Dachshunds, I turn painfully toward the radience from outside, grab my phone to check the time â€“ there is an hour until class begins. Rising with reclutence the view beyond the window reveals a 14 inches of snow that must have arrived last night. What date is it anyway? November 8th, it going to be snowy this year isn't it?
