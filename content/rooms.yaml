  description: 
    The closet sized enclosure, indefinitly smelling of garlic, appears largly barren. Surely the habitat of some bland snow bird egrete wallowing away its 100 years on earth in a meloncholoy silence looking out on the dusty ends of the world. Little fixtures pervade here, a sad looking desk akin to those found cheapest at Staples, stout and dysfunctional, a windowsill with pictures – various plump pill bottles forest green with yellow lables, nutrional concoctions. Towards the door leading into the hallway there is a refrigerator and sink. Across from those amenities, surely only afforded to the most affluent university students, a private bath, pithly arranged for compact catacombness, luxery subsumes the pupil of passers. The closet lacks a closet and its owners belongings rest upon wall mounted shelving and hangers.
